Title: about

My name is Rikard Sandstr√∂m, big data scientist, machine learning expert, senior business advisor, and PhD in experimental particle physics.

I am writing this blog to collect tips and tricks in one easily accessible location.
Many blog posts are based on short tutorials that I am sharing with my colleagues, but I am adapting them to the general public to protect my clients identities.

I am also writing blog posts on my personal view of topics that interests me, e.g., the role of data science in corporate organisations and outlook on future developments.

If you want to contact me, the best way is to use the LinkedIn icon in the bottom of this page.
