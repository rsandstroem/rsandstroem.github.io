This project contains the files used for my Data Scientist Blog.

I am writing this blog to collect tips and tricks in one easily accessible location. Many blog posts are based on short tutorials that I am sharing with my colleagues, but I am adapting them to the general public to protect my clients identities.

I am also writing blog posts on my personal view of topics that interests me, e.g., the role of data science in corporate organisations and outlook on future developments.

The blog is using Pelican and Jupyter notebook plug-ins for generating markdown and html code.
